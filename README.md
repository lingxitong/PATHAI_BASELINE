We are excited to introduce PATHAI_BASELINE, a comprehensive and integrated framework that encompasses foundational code for all downstream tasks in the realm of Pathology AI. This repository is designed to serve as a unified platform for researchers and developers, facilitating the development and application of AI-driven pathology solutions. It includes a wide range of functionalities such as ***WSI-level*** weakly supervised `classification`, `survival analysis`, `few-shot`, `zero-shot`, `semantic-segmentation`, `instance-segmentation`, `retrieval` and `text-generation`; ***patch/ROI-level*** `classification`, `few-shot`, `zero-shot`, `retrieval`, `semantic-segmentation`, `instance segmentation` and `text-generation`; as well as ***pre-and-post processing*** such as `patch-generation`, `feature extraction`, `quality control`, `multi-slide registration` and `WSI-segmentaion pre&postprocess`. By providing a fundamental yet versatile template, PATHAI_BASELINE aims to address the computational and technical challenges posed by the vast complexity of pathological images while promoting reproducibility and ease of use in pathology AI research. Whether you are working on basic classification tasks or more advanced applications like segmentation and retrieval, PATHAI_BASELINE offers a robust starting point to accelerate your projects and foster innovation in this transformative field.
